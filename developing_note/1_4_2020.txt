1/4/2020 update

1. The code in order to calculating CE values using contour technique, merged in this project as contour.cpp file. using command with "./main -contour dataset/birds", it can calculate the value of CEs, connected with if statement as "else if(strcmp(argv[i],"-contour") == 0".

2. Creat the function Count_Column_Numb(), this is using for calulating the number of data column, as updating this function, flexibly can load the different number of CE,(the number of CE with 10, 15, 20 etc).

3. Testing accuracy with CE values of 10, 15 and 20, working fine but there are decreasing trend of accuracy value depending on the high number of CE value. Opposite result than I expected, require more testing

# CE[10]: Mean Square Error: 48 ± 20% 
# CE[15]: Mean Square Error: 46 ± 18% 
# CE[20]: Mean Square Error: 40 ± 16% 

3. the code section for running automatically Gnuplot inside main.cpp, create function of Gnuplot_Generate(), not code change just copy and past.

"1.updating note and dataset categories added, 2. contour.cpp which is using calculating CE merged to this project repository, 3. the flexible number of CE can apply this project. 4. Gnuplot function added in main.cpp"
